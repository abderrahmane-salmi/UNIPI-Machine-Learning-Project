We have applied 4 different models on the ML-CUP25 dataset, which are: KNN, NN, SVM, and Linear Model. We performed model selection and evaluation using grid search with 5-fold cross-validation on a development set (90% of data), then we tested the final model on our internal test set (10% of data). The final model is KNN with K=3 and distance weighting, which is the most effective model because it achieved a Mean Euclidean Error (MEE) of 15.1285 on our internal test set.
